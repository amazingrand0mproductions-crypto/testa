// entity and later get written directly into the AI-visible "Established
// Facts" card, keys and all, as if it were a real character or place name
// — confirmed directly via sandbox: "Muttered something under his breath,
// wouldn't meet their eyes..." created a thread on "Muttered" that
// resolved into an Established Facts card entry reading "Muttered: Someone
// in the story isn't who they appear to be... Treat all of this as settled
// fact going forward," with "Muttered" as a match key — meaning that card
// would then spuriously fire on any future ordinary use of the word. One
// shared base list means a future gap only needs finding and fixing once,

// retry with zero cards created; reveal requests producing nothing

// cache-efficient warning card active at the time, so this closes a real
